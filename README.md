My Intro to R presentations

 - All source code is contained within this repository. You can clone it to play with it in R.
 - Previous iterations are cleared away (get them using Releases)

If you have any questions, please contact me. You can drop comments against any of the code files, email me, or [tweet me](http:twitter.com/stefflocke)!
