## Objective
R is a great data analysis and stats language and has lots of practical applications in many businesses. 

Using it can result in a fantastic return on investment as R is free to use, but you'll only get that ROI when you're using it in a robust infrastructure and utilising sensible development practices.  

This training day takes you through the basics of R development, showing you the best practices along the way, then shows you how to setup the Linux infrastructure needed to do team development and to deliver reporting across the company.
