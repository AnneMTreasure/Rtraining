Let's get our own copy of Hadley Wickham's awesome ggplot2 book.

 - Create a new package from source control (git) and use the url <https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book>

 - Once this has been retrieved (you may get problems with "checking out", don't worry, simply open up the project) run the following r code to ensure you have the dependencies:
```r
install.packages(c("knitr", "ggplot2", "jpeg", "mgcv",
                  "lubridate", "rvest", "magrittr",
                  "gridExtra", "dplyr", "tidyr", "xtable",
                  "nlme", "effects", "broom", "hexbin",
                  "maps", "Hmisc"))
devtools::install_github(c("adletaw/captioner", "hadley/bookdown"))

```

- We need a LaTeX installation too ... [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/download) and an extra font (Inconsolata)

Alternatively, we can just browse the markdown files on git but you won't be able to see the charts
