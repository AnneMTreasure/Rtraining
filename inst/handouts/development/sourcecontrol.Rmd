> SOURCE CONTROL IS FOR ALL THE THINGS

## Fundamentals
Source control is important because it provides:

 - a backup system for your code
 - a means of tracking *why* you made changes
 - a way of sharing code
 - a system for multiple people to work safely
 - another potential way to deploy code manually
 - options for automated testing and deployment
 - audit trails
 
There are two types of source control systems:

 - centralised
 - distributed

Centralised means that there is a single storage location and to work on a file it must be exclusively checked out. Distributed systems involve taking copies of the code base, making changes, and pushing these back to primary storage location.

Both have their own disadvantages but since with distributed source control you never get the situation where someone's left a file checked out as they go on holiday and no-one else can use it, I'm a big fan of distributed source control systems.

## Git
Git is a distributed source control system. 

It integrates neatly into Rstudio, making it easy to source control your analysis.



### The git conceptual model ([\@cthydng](https://twitter.com/cthydng/status/575483540202106880))

### Git glossary

 - Repository: Your project and it's history
 - Remote: The (TFS/GitHub/VSO etc) server
 - Clone:Take a linked copy of a repository
 - Fork: Take an unlinked copy of a repository
 - Pull: Update your copy of a repository
 - Add: Include a file in a change
 - Commit: Make the latest state of all the added files the new default state
 - Push: Update the central copy of the repository with your commits
 
There are more terms. For a friendly glossary see [Github's git glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/), and for an extensive, technical glossary see the official [Git glossary](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitglossary.html)

## git2r
The package `git2r` supports a source control workflow directly within R. This means you can continue to use Rstudio for even complex git tasks. And of course there's always the shell option in Rstudio.

For a handy Git cheatsheet, check out this [GitHub one](https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf).

The [git2r documentation](https://github.com/ropensci/git2r) is pretty good. It's easier though to use once you've been utilising the Rstudio GUI for a bit, and dabbling with the command line.
