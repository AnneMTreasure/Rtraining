> SOURCE CONTROL IS FOR ALL THE THINGS

## Fundamentals
Source control is important because it provides:

 - a backup system for your code
 - a means of tracking *why* you made changes
 - a way of sharing code
 - a system for multiple people to work safely
 - another potential way to deploy code manually
 - options for automated testing and deployment
 - audit trails
 
There are two types of source control systems:

 - centralised
 - distributed

Centralised means that there is a single storage location and to work on a file it must be exclusively checked out. Distributed systems involve taking copies of the code base, making changes, and pushing these back to primary storage location.

Both have their own disadvantages but since with distributed source control you never get the situation where someone's left a file checked out as they go on holiday and no-one else can use it, I'm a big fan of distributed source control systems.

## Git
Git is a distributed source control system. 

It integrates neatly into Rstudio, making it easy to source control your analysis.
