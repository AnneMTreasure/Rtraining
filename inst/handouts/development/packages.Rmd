## What's a package?
A package is a collection of functionality designed to achieve one or more purposes. Commonly it is a bundle of functions that help tackle a certain type of analysis.

Packages are great ways to modularise your code and create standardised ways of doing specific tasks in your organisation, like charts (`optiRum::theme_optimum()`).

## The package development Bible
There is an [R foundation guide to writing packages](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html). I don't recommend you start with that! It is however what any package that you submit to the central repository of R packages (CRAN) will be held against - so if you'd like to get a package on CRAN you will need to read this.

The better, more accessible book [R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) is by Hadley Wickham and will cover things in a lot of depth but is more accesable and has exercises.

## How do you build a package?
The easiest way to build a good quality package is to use the package devtools. This is a package designed specifically to make life easier for package developers. 

Here is my typical workflow:
```r
library(devtools)
pkg<-"newPackage"
create(pkg)

# Open the project!

library(devtools)

# Add unit test framework
add_test_infrastructure()

# Add CI framework
add_travis()

# Add folder for macro-level help files
use_vignette()

# Add file for providing info about your package
use_package_doc()

# Add a file for storing comments about the release if submitting to CRAN
use_cran_comments()

# Create various useful files
file.create("README.md")
file.create("NEWS")

# Set git up
library(git2r)
init(".")
```

Once I have this skeleton I fill in the various bits of info about my package in DESCRIPTION, README, R/package.R, and so forth.

After I've done some basic hygiene, I can start building my R functions and associated tests.
