## Using R for documents
Producing documents / documentation directly in R means that you closely interweave (knit) your analysis and R code together. This reduces rework time when you want to change or extend your code, it reduces time to produce new versions, and because it's code it's easier to apply strong software development principles to it.

Oh, and you don't need to spend hours making text boxes in powerpoint! Win ;-)

There are two languages which you can knit your r code into:

 - markdown
 - LaTeX (pronounced lay-tech alas)

Markdown is great for very quick generation and light (or css driven) styling and is what this section focusses on. LaTeX is excellent for producing stunning, more flexible documents.
 
## rmarkdown standard text

**The following text is the default text that gets created when you produce a new rmarkdown file in rstudio**

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## rmarkdown standard documentation

**The following text is part of the standard documentation on rmarkdown. I pull it from [github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/gh-pages/authoring_basics.md) and integrate it using knitr. It is better than I could produce and the act of integrating it gives an extra example of useful ways to build documents.**

```{r grab, echo=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
setInternet2(use = TRUE)
x <- tempfile(fileext = "Rmd")
on.exit(unlink(x))
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/gh-pages/authoring_basics.md", x)
```

```{r test-main, child=x}
```
