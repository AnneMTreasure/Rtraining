## rmarkdown standard text

**The following text is the default text that gets created when you produce a new rmarkdown file in rstudio**

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## rmarkdown standard documentation

**The following text is part of the standard documentation on rmarkdown. I pull it from [github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/gh-pages/authoring_basics.md) and integrate it using knitr. It is better than I could produce and the act of integrating it gives an extra example of useful ways to build documents.**

```{r grab, echo=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
setInternet2(use = TRUE)
x <- tempfile(fileext = "Rmd")
on.exit(unlink(x))
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/gh-pages/authoring_basics.md", x)
```

```{r test-main, child=x}
```
