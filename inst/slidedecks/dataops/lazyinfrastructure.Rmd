## Laziness commandments
- Do work today that avoids repeat work down the line
- Do boring work today so tomorrow's work is new and interesting
- Don't end up in the situation where you have to the same bit of work twice


# My machine
```{r autodoc, child='subDocs/chocolatey.Rmd', eval=TRUE}
```

```{r autodoc, child='subDocs/docker.Rmd', eval=TRUE}
```

## Storage
> Never rely on your machine for more than temporary storage

- Source control
- Dropbox (or OneDrive)

## And ...
- PowerShell
- Soon ... Ubuntu!

# My servers

## Servers
> Don't own any

## Azure VMs
- Pre-canned where possible
- Use Azure Resource Manager templates for scripted builds

## Ubuntu
- I confess to preferring Linux than Windows Server!
- DigitalOcean is a really neat cloud provider

## Ditching the servers
