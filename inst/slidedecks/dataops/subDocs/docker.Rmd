# Docker {data-background-iframe="https://www.docker.com/"}

## Docker
- Contained code
- Scripted infrastructure
- Bundled dependencies
- Lower maintenance than VMs

## Why use it?
- Scripted installs
- Saved from "Next, Next, Next"
- Insanely disposable

## How to use it
- Install it
- Run the Docker Quickstart Terminal

```
> docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
```

## Considerations
- *Currently* uses a VM that requires memory allocation (default = 2 Gb)
- Make sure to bin old images or instances
- Big shift in thinking
