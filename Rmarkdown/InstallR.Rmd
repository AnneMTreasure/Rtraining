## Notes on installing R
- R can typically be installed without UAC being triggered
- R uses packages to extend itself so you need to be able to download zip files
- Rstudio will update on a relatively regularly basis and does hit UAC
- R and Rstudio work better on linux as it's easier to get the additional components that can be required for some packages
- I would also recommend the installation of 
    + MikTex (Windows variant of LaTeX) and Pandoc for documentation
    + Git for source control (integrates with TFS!)
