##Dynamic documents {#document}
CONCEPT: modular documents that contain text and analysis that update

This is pretty much impossible in the Office paradigm.  

* You can make refreshable Excel spreadsheets but stuff with words as well is hard to update
* It's really hard to collaborate on a single Word document
* PowerPoint requires a lot of clicking and C&Ping

R integrates with LaTeX, markdown, and pandoc to enable the blending of code and content to enable documents to be produced from scratch each time.

##What are the benefits?

* Change a bit of the code and the whole document updates
* Modular development enables easier development (particularly in a collaborative setting)
* Reduction in errors caused by C&Ping
* Consistent looks and feel of documents and reports
* Documented as you go
* No stress about updating a document
* Variety of export formats

##How's it done?
* You can write LaTeX and markdown (think wikipedia and SO) outside of R
* There are packages like knitr designed to allow you to embed your R analysis in a variety of other languages
* Work in Rstudio to benefit from their full integration of these packages
