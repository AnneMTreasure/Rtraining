## About R {#aboutr}
R is a programming language for analysing data.  Fundamentally, R allows you to directly code analysis, reports, and statistical models.

### Why is that a good thing?
* Code is syntax -- easy to apply principals to new language
* Time reduction -- less clicking means more time thinking
* Standards -- unit testing, code review, source control etc

### Great, so what else?
* It's free and totally customisable
* It works on Windows and with SQL Server
* It looks awesome, so you look awesome

## Some R niggles
Like any technology there are some current quirks or limitations

* Based on [S][1] which was written in the 70s
* For a long time, was the sole province of academic statisticians
* It's open so there are competing coding paradigms (also a benefit!)
* It can take a while to get the hang of googling for R
* No robust MDX package as yet
