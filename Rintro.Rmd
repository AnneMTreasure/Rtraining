```

```{r autodoc, child='AboutMe.Rmd', eval=TRUE}
```

```{r autodoc, child='Scenario.Rmd', eval=TRUE}
```

## Step 1: Google "What is R?"
I [Google](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=what+is+r) frantically and find out...

- R (birthed out of S) has been around for ages
- Has [massively increased in popularity](http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html)
- Lots of big players like SAP, TIBCO, and Oracle have implemented it
- It's statistician heaven!
- It produces very pretty charts
- Huh, you can make [XKCD cartoons in it](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12675147/how-can-we-make-xkcd-style-graphs-in-r)?

Eep, but I'm not a stats bod or a programmer, what will I do? Do my usual stuff, but swisher!

## Step 2: Get R installed
OK, I need to get this thing called R installed on my laptop!

- Install R from [r-project.org](http://www.r-project.org/) myself
- Wait for IT to install Rstudio via [Rstudio.com](http://www.rstudio.com) for me
- Use R to nab some useful packages

------
```{r autodoc, child='Packages.Rmd', eval=TRUE}
```

```{r autodoc, child='Database.Rmd', eval=TRUE}
```

```{r autodoc, child='Dataset.Rmd', eval=TRUE}
```

```{r autodoc, child='Summarise.Rmd', eval=TRUE}
```

```{r autodoc, child='Visualisation.Rmd', eval=TRUE}
```

## Step 7: Produce presentation
I need a slide deck for the boss to take use!

- Use `rmarkdown` to produce `SamplePresentation.Rmd`
- Really light syntax, same as [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow)
- Customisable via CSS
- Create slides (html or PDF) or docs (html, PDF, Word)
- Use a modular design
- Re-knit to get latest data 

```{r autodoc, child='Shiny.Rmd', eval=TRUE}
```

Phew, I managed to deliver something to the boss! He's got something he can show to the Board & a web page he can play with all day long.

We learnt along the way:

- connect to our data using `RODBC`
- manipulate it with `ggplot2`
- make documents with `rmarkdown`
- produce interactive reports using `shiny` 

Not bad for a day's work!

## Where next?{.smaller}
OK, so I did some basics but there's still a lot to learn. Here are my top resources for learning more:

### Online (hands on)
- Basic R [CodeSchool](http://tryr.codeschool.com)
- Modern R [DataCamp](http://datacamp.com)
- Statistics R [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience)

### In-person
- R user groups e.g. [LondonR](http://www.londonr.org/)
- Training courses e.g. [Mango]() <- See me after for a 50% discount

### Useful online resources
- [R-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/)
