"1","(Near) Zero-Downtime Upgrades","Argenis Fernandez",NA,NA,"200","DBA","SQL Server upgrades often promise enticing new features and much needed enhancements, but how can you perform upgrades while maintaining high availability of your SQL Server infrastructure? You can actually do this by leveraging rolling upgrades, which are upgrades performed with minimal downtime and minimal service disruptions.   In this session you will: - Understand how rolling upgrades are better than in place upgrades - Learn how to use Database Mirroring or AlwaysOn Availability Groups for rolling upgrades - Explore how you can use Log Shipping to perform a simpler type of rolling upgrade This is an interactive, demo-intensive talk!"
"2","10 Handy Tips on SQL Server Dates","Julie Koesmarno",NA,NA,"200","Dev","Are you working with an application supporting different time zones and international date formats? How does your choice of storing date / time values differ if you are using Windows Azure SQL Database instead of on-prem SQL Server database? Did you know that SQL Server Database Engine, Integration Services (SSIS) and Analysis Services (SSAS) all have slightly different date / time data types? How can you bullet proof your system for the ever growing data in your organization with much more date and time data to come? With time being the one thing that constantly changes, date and time calculations are widely used and essential to all business transactions. Yet, most systems only use one or two date data types; Is this a wise decision? Quite often data retrieval relating to a period of time does performs poorly, or worst of all, is not accurate. These 10 tips will help you bridge the gap, and provide the techniques to build bulletproof systems the users demand and DESERVE!"
"3","14 Reasons to Migrate to SQL Server 2014","Ajay Jadoo",NA,NA,"300","DBA","SQL Server 2014 has was released about a year ago and if you are not already running this version, it is high time to migrate. While SQL Server 2014 came with an abundance of new features and improvements, the In-Memory OLTP (Hekaton) and the Updatable columnstore indexes have been talked about much. While these are ground-breaking additions, there are so many other reasons why you should migrate to SQL Server 2014 and benefit from the other new features and enhancements. This session (with the help of some demos) will cover all the SQL Server 2014 Gems (some of which are lesser known) and provide you with many reasons why you should migrate to and/or start using this version. As a taster, some of the new features this session will cover:Backup Enhancements and Encrypted      Enhanced Scalability     New Design for Cardinality Estimation     Delayed Durability     AlwaysOn Enhancements     Buffer Pool Extension     Resource Governor Enhancements for Physical IO Control     New Security Features     Online Index Operations     ... and some hiddens gems"

"8","A New Approach to Unit and Integration Testing in SSIS","Reeves Smith",NA,NA,"300","BI","Testing is a critical part of the release process and vital to a high-quality data management lifecycle. Unfortunately, Integration Services (SSIS) does not have built-in support for testing and the tools for relational database testing are limited. As a result, most organizations forgo automated testing and focus entirely on manual user testing, which is both expensive and often occurs too late in the process to address all of the issues discovered.  In this session, a new approach to unit testing (focusing on verifying the correctness of individual packages, tasks, or dataflows) and integration testing (focusing on validating that the data produced by an entire sequence of transformations) will be discussed. This development pattern uses metadata authored by analysts to automatically generate testing logic within the corresponding packages or to automatically generate standalone test packages that contain all of the necessary validation logic."
"9","A journey to Power BI","Leila Etaati",NA,NA,"200","BI","The aim of this session is to introduce easier way than corporate BI .Power BI is a self- service tool which can handle all ETL process (extract, transfer and load), manage, discover, and visualize data.

"13","Abstract data layers in Microsoft SQL Server","Uwe Ricken",NA,NA,"200","Dev","Many developers are working with direct access to the data layer of a database (tables) by ORM or .NET, Access, ... This access methode maybe a good choice for small applications which use a dedicated database where no security or business requirement is needed. This session demonstrates protection of data by using schemata for data protection and implementation of business logic for multiple applications. The session content will deal with data integrity on attribute / row / table level. It will show how to protect sensitive data without management of access from the application as well. Usage of constraints for data integrity, schemas for security and views / stored procedures for business rules will be part of the demo driven presentation."
"14","Accelerate you SSIS Development with BI Markup Language","Sander van der Hoeff",NA,NA,"300","BI","Ever ended up with a source system where an old datatype was replaced with a new one so you had to rebuild all your SSIS packages? Entered a project with SSIS packages which needed a complete rebuild to perform but you didn’t have the time for a rebuild of your whole project?Client specifications changed (again) and you had to start all over again building all your packages?Had to import hundreds of text files but had no idea where to start? We did it all and rebuild 100+ SSIS packages within a day using biml for generating SSIS packages. And with a generator at hand, we were able to absorb a new version of a source system including analysis of the changes made in the source in only two days. And the best of all, BIML is part of BIDSHelper and free to use!Don' t just believe what I say, In my session I will demonstrate where to start. I will show you around in BIML. After the quick basics of BIML I will show you how, with very basic programming knowledge, you can parameterize the BIML script in order to multiply the template to multiple packages over and over again (when needed of course)."
"15","Actually using source control and unit testing with SQL","Ed Elliott",NA,NA,"200","Dev","It seems that for years us Sql developers haven't needed to use source control, we backup our databases which contain the source so why would we need to? Times are changing, with the addition of SSDT (Sql Server Data Tools) to our tool set we now, more than ever, need to join the rest of the development community and start using source control - if you are convinced of the benefits and maybe have even tried to get your database under source control and got stuck or don't even know where to start then this is the session for you. Once the database is under source control then we move onto the next great thing, testing - with frameworks like DBUnit, tSQLt and even the Microsoft supplied MSTest we can easily start writing automated testing which allows us, if done correctly, to make our code:Easier to write     Easier to understand     Easier to debug     Less prone to bugs  If you have tried to start unit testing but again did not know how to actually get started then this session will give some practical examples of how to actually get setup and working productively. There is no point in trying to do something that just adds a massive overhead to your development so come here and learn how to integrate unit testing with your development and make a step towards more modern and agile Sql Server development!"

From SQL Server Tools in Management Studio, throught Wizard and Designer, to advanced scripts and methods."
"17","Advanced Backup and Restore","Pieter Vanhove",NA,NA,"400","DBA","A good backup and restore strategy is the most important thing that a DBA should be worried about each day. Most DBA's know the standard options for implementing a basic backup and restore plan. But there are also not so well known options that can help you with a more advanced recovery plan and that will increase the speed of your backups and restores. This session is bulk loaded with demos and it will give you a good idea what infrequently features can be helpful in your environment, like:   Backup     Partial backups"
"18","Advanced Query Tuning Techniques","Guy Glantser",NA,NA,"400","Dev","You identified a query that is causing performance issues, and your mission is to optimize it and boost performance. You looked at the execution plan and created all the relevant indexes. You even updated statistics, but performance is still bad. Now what? In this session we will analyze common use cases of poorly performing queries, such as improper use of scalar functions, inaccurate statistics and bad impact of parameter sniffing.

"20","Advanced Subscriptions with Reporting Services","Leonard Matter",NA,NA,"300","BI","Reporting Services is a great tool to send out reports by email or files. But if you ran into limitations with the subscriptions microsoft offers, or if it's not as easy as you would like to, this session is for you. I'll show you how to integrate your reporting tasks in ETL jobs, how to manage your distribution lists centrally, how to update parameters and manage smtp issues. Spoiler: This will be using Reporting Services web services, some c# programming, and some free tools."
"21","Advanced Time Intelligence","Alberto Ferrari",NA,NA,"300","BI","Any business report requires some sort of time intelligence calculation: year-to-date, month-to-date, same period last year, growth in absolute value and as a percentage. You can implement most of the time intelligence calculations using standard DAX functions but, when it comes to handling complex scenarios, only modeling, imagination and technique together can help you solve the challenge. In this session, Alberto Ferrari will quickly run through the basic time intelligence technique and then performs a deep analysis of more advanced scenarios, like week-based calendar, non-contiguous date selection, moving windows over time and handling of holidays in different countries. It is also a good chance to see how DAX and data modes can help you solve complex problems."
"22","Agile BI","Stephanie Locke",NA,NA,"200","BI","From scrums to sprints to a mountain of post-its, there's a world of weird and wacky project management stuff going on in the dev world. It's making it easier to get things done rapidly but how does it apply to BI and what does it all mean? This session covers: - agile concepts - useful techniques for BI projects and ongoing work - how to model and iterate data warehouses rapidly - the technological components that can help deliver agile BI After this session you should be equipped to start your first steps on the road to better quality, faster, and more collaborative BI."
"23","Agile BI: tips to deliver a DWH solution using SCRUM","Florian Eiden",NA,NA,"300","BI","Now that we all master the delivery of a BI solution using traditional waterfall or V-model software development cycles and SQL Server components, it's time to enter the 21st century and adopt Agile Methodologies: inscribed in Agile values, iterative on functional scopes and not technical ones, part of a cycle of continuous improvement for people and solutions."
"24","Alarm for Data Governance! Self-Service BI is coming","Oliver Engels",200,2015-03-06,"200","BI","Self-Service BI functionality is one of the big goals of the modern Microsoft BI stack. But with the ability to bring business intelligence functionality to a much broader audience the danger of inconsistency, redundancy of information and accountability as well as security concerns and data quality problems can increase. In this session, we will show data governance best practices and what capabilities for data governance Power BI has in place. In addition, we’ll discuss how you can enhance your self-service BI landscape with Master Data and Data Quality Services for improved governance."
"25","All About Indexing","Hugo Kornelis",300,2015-03-07,"300","Dev","We all know indexes can speed up queries. But why? And how? Why is “index on every column” not a good indexing strategy, why is your shiny new index not used, and why can adding indexes even hurt performance? The key to answering this is understanding how SQL Server lays out your data on disk, how this changes when you add an index, and how SQL Server uses these indexes to find the information required for your queries. The first part of this presentation will provide in-depth insight in how heaps, clustered indexes, and nonclustered indexes are organized on disk; and how they are used for scans, seeks, and lookups. The second part will then continue on advanced features, such as included columns, indexed views, and filtered indexes. You will see the tools SQL Server itself hands you to help identify just the right subset of indexes, and their limitations and weaknesses. And finally, you will get a stunning demonstration of just how bad you can HURT performance by creating too many indexes. Armed with this information, you should be able to find just the right set of indexes for your workload."
"26","All about Indexes","Gail Shaw",300,2015-03-06,"300","Dev","Indexes are essential to good database performance, but it can be hard to decide what indexes to create and the ‘rules’ around indexes often appear to be vague or downright contradictory. In this full day session we’ll dive deep into indexes, have a look at their architecture and internal structure and how that affects the way that indexes are used in query execution. We’ll look at why clustered indexes are recommended on almost all tables and how their architecture affects the choice of columns. We’ll look at nonclustered indexes; their architecture and how query design affects what indexes should be created to support various queries."
"27","AlwaysOn Live Deployment","Ryan Adams",NA,NA,"300","DBA","This session is 90% live demonstrations.  I'll walk you through a complete AlwaysOn deployment.  You will see firsthand how to install and configure an AlwaysOn Failover Cluster.  I'll also show you how to setup an AlwaysOn Availability Group across 5 nodes using both the GUI and T-SQL so you know why and when to use each method.  I'll finish up by showing how you can connect to a readable secondary."
"28","Amazing Things You Can Do With Power BI","Chris Webb",300,2015-03-06,"300","BI","Power BI is a dream tool when it comes to demos.

In this session we will look in detail into some of the features for the Power BI designer and take it for a spin and investigating some of the new capabilities it has to offer for different relationships and new DAX formulas."
"32","Analysing Text with SQL Server 2014","Dejan Sarka",300,2015-03-07,"300","BI","Text mining is becoming more and more popular. Everybody would like to understand data from blogs, Web sites, and social media. Microsoft SQL Server in versions 2012 and 2014 enhances full-text search support that was substantially available in previous editions. Semantic Search, a new component in Full-Text Search, can help you understanding the meaning of documents. The Term Extraction and Term Lookup components from SQL Server Integration Services also help with text analysis. However, the question arises: is all this enough? This presentation unveils the good and the bad side of text mining with the tools mentioned."
"33","Analytics Master Class-exploiting exotic patterns in data","Mark Whitehorn",300,2015-03-07,"300","BI","Analysis of raw data requires us to find and understand complex patterns in that data.  We all have a toolbox of techniques and methodologies that we use; the more tools we have, the better we are at the job of analysis.  Some of these tools are well known, data mining for example. This talk covers some of the less well-known techniques that are still directly applicable to this kind of analytics.  These include: Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) Nyquist’s Theorem Benford’s Law Simpson’s paradox This session will focus on how understanding these techniques can help you understand complex data patterns in your day-to-day work. For example, it turns out that some problems are very, very difficult to solve by standard mathematics.  Take the random walk problem, for example.   If you stand in a desert and take each step in a random direction, how far are you from your origin (on average) after n steps?  Given that Albert Einstein worked on the problem, the mathematical proof is obviously non-trivial.  (Unlike the answer, which is simply the square root of n).  That self-same problem can be solved using a Monte Carlo simulation which can be written in just nine lines of code.   I fully understand that you are unlikely to want to solve this particular problem (for a start, it’s already been solved and, in addition, who would really walk like that in a desert?).  But the point is that many problems, from understanding web page usage to the behaviour of users of a video-on-demand system, are horribly difficult to solve as a mathematical problem and ludicrously easy (in relative terms) using a Monte Carlo simulation.  Nyquist’s Theorem can be used to tell us, for example, how often to sample smart electricity meters, and much more.  Benford’s Law is fabulously powerful for detecting fraud and so on. This session will NOT include any heavy (or, indeed, light!) mathematics; instead, it will focus on how understanding these techniques can help you understand complex data patterns in your day-to-day work.    It is a shortened version of a pre-conference, day-long session that I gave at PASS earlier this year."
"34","Analytics and PowerBI-Mythbusting the news","Jennifer Stirrup",NA,NA,"200","BI","Fans of BBC Radio 4's 'More or Less' will be familiar with the mythbusting theme, where we take some ridiculously wild news headlines and explore the data to understand what really happened. Join us for a fun newspaper-headline myth bashing session using Power BI, inspired by myth busters such as Tim Harman and other headline exposers. We will look at data journalism in various media, and see how it helps us to understand better using data visualisation and PowerBI."
"35","Analyze data streams with Azure stream analytics","Nico Jacobs",300,2015-03-05,"300","BI","In many database applications we first log data and then, a few hours or days later, we start analyzing it. But in a world that's moving faster and faster, we sometimes need to analyze what is happening NOW. Azure Stream Analytics allows you to analyze streams of data via a new Azure service. In this session you will see how to get started using this new service. From event hubs on the input side over temporal SQL queries: the demo’s in this session will show you all of it."
"36","Analyzing Your Indexing Strategy","Tim Ford",NA,NA,"300","DBA","Like Frankenstein's Monster (or our teenagers) things get released into the wild and behave differently than planned - database usage patterns are no different.  Join Tim as he goes over what to look for when tweaking your index strategy: poor clustering key decisions, under-used indexes, covering indexes gone wrong, overlooked heaps and fill factor failures are just a few of the blunders to be identified.  Pointing out what is sub-par is only part of the process though.  As a group we will discuss what the better options are based upon what we uncover over these two hours. In a combination of instructor-led training and group discussion formats we will use various constructs including Dynamic Management Objects and System Catalaog Views to identify improvement points and then discuss what we would do differently should we see these issues in our environemnts."
"37","Anchor Modelling: 6NF for agile dbs","Stephanie Locke",NA,NA,"400","Dev","Anchor Modelling is a fantastic database modelling paradigm that uses sixth normal form (6NF) to store data in and provides third normal form (3NF) views for ease of use. This session showcases Anchor Modelling to allow for a purely additive development process for databases that reduces development, testing and deployment time. Covering the theory and practical tips from our experience it provides a solid intro to a great design model for OLTP and DW databases alike. The session covers the fundamentals of database theory giving you enough to get going, it explores the Anchor Model system, the benefits it brings, and then dives into how you can start incorporating Anchor Modelling into your current database schema and ETL."
"38","Are You Optimistic About Concurrency?","Kalen Delaney",NA,NA,"300","Dev","What exactly does it mean to have optimistic concurrency? What is the alternative? Is SQL Server 2012's SNAPSHOT Isolation optimistic?  How can SQL Server 2014's In-Memory OLTP provide truly optimistic concurrency?   In this session, we'll look at what guarantees the various isolation levels provide, the difference between pessimistic and optimistic concurrency, and the new data structures in SQL Server 2014 that allow the enormous benefits of having totally in-memory storage with no waiting!"
"39","Azure Data Factory vs SSIS","Reza Rad",NA,NA,"300","BI","SSIS is a well known ETL tool on premisses. Azure Data Factory is a managed service on cloud which provides ability to extract data from different sources, transform it with data driven pipelines, and process the data. in this session you will see many demos comparing ADF (Azure Data Factory) with SSIS in different aspects. you will also learn features that are available in ADF but not in SSIS with many demos."
"40","Azure Data Factory-More than just Cloud SSIS","Allan Mitchell",NA,NA,"200","BI","Want to do data transformations in the cloud?  Been wondering when SSIS would port to the cloud?  Azure Data Factory is not SSIS but a ground up rethink of moving data in Azure.   Come to this session to understand how to take your data and move it through a cloud based transformation at scale."

"42","Azure Networks and VMs for the DB Guy","Rik Hepworth",300,2015-03-05,"300","Dev","Sometimes don't want our data in the cloud, but that doesn't mean we can't use the cloud at all. Windows Azure allows private networks to be defined that can host virtual machines, connect securely to our on-premises network and act as a bridge for scalable Azure Websites. In this session I'll create a network, add VMs and connect in a website. I'll talk about how it could be connected to on-prem and run through the concepts involved."
"43","AzureML versus SQL Server Data Mining","Nico Jacobs",NA,NA,"300","BI","Since SQL Server 2000 there is a machine learning (or data mining, if you prefer) engine within SQL Server Analysis Services. But in 2014 Microsoft launched AzureML, a machine learning engine within Azure, their cloud platform. Is newer better? Should we turn our attention solely to the new kid around the block?  In this session we will compare both products in live demos, show the strong and weak points in both of these products. So if you plan on doing predictive analysis in the near future, come to this session to see which product fits best with your project."
"44","BI DBA Performance Tuning","Bradley Ball",300,2015-03-06,"300","BI","Data Warehouses and OLTP systems are different!  But there are some core concepts that we need to understand for managing and maintaining both.  Do you want to know how you can load data faster, just by setting up your database correctly?  Are your queries running slow?  Want to understand how you can reduce locking and blocking in reporting queries?  Do you have a system with views, that reference views, which reference more views?  Let's discuss some core concepts and techniques that will get you out of the slow lane and on your way to a faster Data Warehouse!"
"45","BI for non-BI folks","Edgar Walther",NA,NA,"200","BI","What is it that all these BI people are so excited about? Why does a data warehouse differ from a ""normal"" database? Why is creating reports not just creating reports? What Microsoft products are involved?  In this fully packed one-hour session everyone who is not familiar with Business Intelligence concepts is introduced to the world of BI.

"93","DBCC TRACEON (2312)-Version 120 of the cardinality estimat","Karel Coenye",NA,NA,"400","DBA","At a very high level, the Cardinaltiy Estimation process in SQL Server 2012 was the same through all prior releases back to SQL Server 7.0    In recent years there were a lot of fixes or QFEs in regards to query optimization (including cardinality estimation) under trace flag in order not to cause a general regression    over all those releases due to changed behavior by the Cardinality estimator.   With the release of SQL Server 2014, there has been a major overhaul to what was basically the CE as introduced 15 years ago. O   to avoid issues that were not fixable without a major redesign.        Knowing that the Cardinality Estimator has changed and purposefully was not overcautiously re-architected to avoid regressions, as it is NOT integrated following the principals of the QFEs   The end result is that the new SQL Server 2014 Cardinality Estimator creates better plans for many queries, especially complex queries,    but also result in worse plans for some queries than the old Cardinality Estimator resulted in.        This session will show you    how to activate the new CE, what's changed, How to debug it, we’ll walk through the density calculations, some combined Filter and key Scenario’s and see how this impacts your performance"
"94","DIY Performance Reporting with SQL Server 2014","Sean McCown",NA,NA,"300","DBA","Graphing Perfmon metrics doesn’t have to be left to 3rd party applications with hefty price tags.  Windows and SQL Server already have all you need to collect and report on server performance.  And DIY (Do-It-Yourself) reporting is more flexible than what you’ll get from a vendor.  Creating your own reports is much more than a “poor man’s method”; I’ll show you why it’s really the preferred method.  Not only are DIY reports free, you can customize them to do things that expensive solutions don’t even think of, like handling clusters, AvailabilityGroups, mirroring, or any other custom scenario you have.  You’ll be surprised how easy it is to create your own reports with Perfmon data. A savvy DBA can stand-up a solution in just a couple hours. And after attending this session you’ll have with a framework you can setup and start using with very little effort.  You will also walk away with the skills you need to turn your reporting solution into an enterprise-level baseline repository."

"121","Design Patterns of Data Warehousing ETL with SSIS","Reza Rad",NA,NA,"400","BI","There
are some challenges in implementing ETL for real world data warehouse. In this one day conference we will deep in dive for challenges such as; Inferred Dimension Member, Slowly Changing Dimension, Late and Early Arriving fact tables, Durable natural Keys, Accumulating fact tables. SSIS best practice and practical solution will be discussed and you will see live demos of solving above challenges with SSIS (combined with MDS sometimes). Challenges above are avoidable in most of the data warehouses, so a pragmatic solution with considering best practices would be necessary learning for every ETL and BI developer, consultant, and architect.
Each challenge will be discussed in this way; defining the problem, exploring what is data warehousing solution for the problem, exploring issues of ETL implementation for that solution, elaborating different methods to implement the solution, proposing the best practice and practical real world ETL solution for the problem. Lots of live demos will be used in each step.
Here is the more detailed explanation for the Inferred Dimension Member Solution with SSIS and MDS; 
Combining Master Data Services with Data Warehouses, will cause some challenges in ETL Scenarios. In this section we will go through a demo of Inferred Dimension Members implementation with SSIS considering the fact that MDS keeps the single version of truth for the dimension record. In this section you will learn how we will write back new record's data into MDS entity as an Inferred member. The staging structure of Master Data Services and Batch Processing will be used for this. Then you will learn what is the best practice to add the inferred record into Data Warehouse dimension. Updating the existing dimension member also would consider the Inferred member and apply SCD types only if this is not an inferred Member.

"123","Designing a database to best support multidimensional OLAP","Dr John Tunnicliffe",200,2015-03-05,"200","BI","Data warehouse designers often ignore the specific needs of an OLAP database when formulating their schema design.  They consider the cube as 'just another reporting layer', with no specific needs.  In a world where businesses need instant answers, this approach can be dangerous as it can seriously degrade your cube's load performance and make incremental loads nigh on impossible.  This session will outline the best way to optimise your data warehouse schema so that it complements, rather than fights, your multidimensional OLAP database, allowing your cube to be loaded efficiently and moreover facilitating fast incremental loads so that new data is brought on-line quickly.

In this talk we have a look at typical problems SQL Server administrators are facing... and how to analyze them using the Microsoft BI tools. From simple reporting up to data mining, this talk covers (and uncovers) them all..."
"136","Estimation and Statistics : The Basis of query optimization","Dave Ballantyne",400,2015-03-06,"400","DBA","At the heart of SQL Server is the cost based optimizer. Stop and think about that a minute, the optimizer attempts to give the “best plan” based on the cost of the work undertaken.  How does it know the cost of the work before its done the work ? This isn’t a conundrum, it doesn’t. It estimates! How does it estimate ? That is statistics.  This will be a deep dive into how the optimizer makes its decisions to give you a plan, the things that can go wrong and how you can have influence over these choices."
"137","Evaluate your Daily Checklist with Policy Based Management","John Sterrett",NA,NA,"300","DBA","You will walk away from this session with an understanding of how to use the Policy Based Management and Central Management Server to complete a daily checklist against your whole SQL Server farm.

"146","Five Ways to Write More Effective Triggers","Aaron Bertrand",200,2015-03-05,"200","Dev","You've got a piece of code that you want to implement as a trigger, but you've read that triggers can grind your performance to a halt. Developers everywhere write triggers to implement business logic, to enforce certain types of constraints, or to avoid changing database schema or external code. Many triggers are inefficient and violate best practices, but it doesn't have to be this way.  Join this session and learn how to improve your triggers and keep them off the list of potential scapegoats for your SQL Server performance woes."
"147","Flat Files Best Practices","Leonard Matter",NA,NA,"300","BI","Flat files can be very time-consuming, and also very error prone. Columns move, some are added, data types change and you're not notified in advance. These errors are quite tricky to track down and make your ETL fail right at the beginning. SSIS isn't very helpful here, it doesn't allow new columns at runtime and the column metadata is kept inside the package. I will show what I mean with pre-processing, and how a little custom built tool can help making this robust."

"151","Generate SSIS packages automatically with Biml & BimlScript","Cathrine Wilhelmsen",NA,NA,"200","BI","SSIS is a powerful tool for extracting, transforming and loading data, but creating and maintaining a large number of SSIS packages can be both tedious and time-consuming. Even if you use templates and follow best practices you often have to repeat the same steps over and over again. There are no easy ways to handle metadata and schema changes, and if there are new requirements you might have to go through all the packages one more time. It's time to bring the Don't Repeat Yourself principle to SSIS development. In this session I will use the free BIDS Helper add-in to show you the basics of Biml and BimlScript, how to generate SSIS packages automatically from databases, how easy those packages can be changed, and how to move common code to separate files that can be included where needed.

"161","Hadoop: From Hive with Stinger to Tez","Jan Pieter Posthuma",300,2015-03-05,"300","BI","For long Hadoop and MapReduce were linked together. Additional data manipulation libraries, like Hive, were added to query the stored data more easily. But with the growth of the amount of data and cluster sizes, MapReduce became too slow and with the release of Hadoop2 YARN was introduced to schedule the resources in a Hadoop cluster. Parallel with the creation of YARN Hortonworks, Microsofts Hadoop partner, launched the Stinger initiative to speedup Hive a 100x in three waves: the first van the introduction of the ORC files, the second wave optimized the query engine and with the third wave Tez was released.

"189","Inventory Valuation Techniques with DAX and Tabular Models","Marco Russo",NA,NA,"300","BI","Inventory Valuation is a common problem in accounting, for which you might already have a dedicated software. From this point of view, a Tabular model should be only a reporting tool for data processed by other tools. However, the powerful in-memory engine allows alternative approaches to this problem, making it possible doing simulation and recalculation in minutes instead of hours. This technique, based on a combined use of Tabular models and DAX expressions, allows the implementation of more granular and accurate techniques in Inventory Valuation.   This session shows several approaches to this scenario, using Analysis Services Tabular as a calculation engine to speed-up complete recalculation of Inventory Valuation caused by corrections to old transactions or particularly complex requirements in calculation definition."

Indeed, with favourable conditions and some preparation,  the whole thing can be over in minutes. However, if hours later it still does not work, troubleshooting can take many days even with help of experts.  As you all know, real world implementations can deviate dramatically from lab scenarios considered in common whitepapers. What most resources usually cover is, at best, some step by step configuration instructions for a particular architecture. Such instructions often lack explanation of why it has to be done that way in terms of the role of every step in the authentication process, i.e. they do not explain principles, only give certain examples. I would like to present easy to follow principles of Kerberos constrained delegation and protocol transition with handy tips and templates to get this right the first time for your particular environment. The goal is to explain the meaning of the settings in terms of the role in the Kerberos constrained delegation authentication rather than simply presenting another example of a particular scenario. I will also include a jargon-busting glossary of terms to help you get started. This presentation covers some very useful resources to help you tame your three-headed monster and make it behave in case it decides to go on a strop.

This will arm you with the knowledge to reject the myths about higher Normal Forms. But, more important: it will make you a better designer! PS: I have entered this session for the DBA track, but it could equally well go into the Dev track. Every workplace appears to have their own ideas on whether the DBA or the Developer needs to be in charge of database design."
"232","Now Where Does THAT Estimate Come From?","Hugo Kornelis",NA,NA,"500","Dev","The SQL Server Query Optimizer makes its plan choices based on estimated rowcounts. If those estimates are wrong, the optimizer will very likely produce a poor plan. And there's nothing you can do about it. Or is there? In this session, you will learn exactly where these estimates come from. You will gain intimate knowledge of how statistics are used to estimate row counts, and how filters and joins further influence those estimates. Though the focus of this session is on understanding the cause of bad estimates, you will also learn some ways to fix the problems and get better estimates - and hence, better performing queries."
"233","ORM Tuning From A Database Perspective","Andre Kamman",200,2015-03-06,"200","Dev","Most ORM's tend to be very chatty and generate complex queries. Which is not a bad thing most of the time, but sometimes it get's out of hand and the queries will either be too complex or, and this I see the most, there will be way to many queries to answer relatively simple questions. Seeing thousands of queries for a simple webpage is not uncommon. In this session we will look at optimizing database access in ORM's. Using Nhibernate, LINQ &Entity Framework in the demos, we will examine how your ORM talks to the database and why. We will look at this problem from 2 sides. As a developer who would like to tweak and tune as little as possible and let the ORM do it's magic, and as a DBA who would like all queries to ask only for the data that you need to have at that time. Using a lot of demo's we will be looking at typical ORM features like Lazy Loading,Mapping, Caching, Inverse Relationships, etc. We will conclude with some best practices and lessons learned."
"234","On Transactions and Atomic Operations","Gail Shaw",100,2015-03-05,"100","Dev","If there’s one thing that we, as SQL developers, don’t do, it’s use enough transactions. Transactions are critical when multiple changes need to be made entirely or not at all, but even given that, it’s rare to see transactions used at all in most production code. In this session, we’ll look at what transactions are and why we should  use them. We’ll explore the effects transactions have on locking and the transaction log. We’ll investigate methods of handling errors and undoing data modifications, and we’ll see why nested transactions are a lie."
"235","Optimizing your SSDT Deployments faster than The Flash","Craig Ottley-Thistlethwaite",500,2015-03-07,"500","Dev","Ever wondered if you can optimize your sql projects so you don't have to do unnecessary work? Take a look at how I've optimized SSDT Deployments by a use case.

In this presentation it will be clarified why this happens and why parameter sniffing is a problem in SQL Server stored procedures. Of course we will offer several solutions for this problem and discuss which solution is applicable in which scenario."
"237","Passive Security for Hostile Environments","Bob Pusateri",NA,NA,"200","DBA","Ideal database security settings usually exist in books, but rarely in reality. Is your CIO a member of the sysadmin role because they demanded it? Or maybe some users have rights for purely political reasons? Just because you can't enforce security through typical means doesn't mean you're powerless. Attend this session to learn about the features SQL Server provides that will allow you to keep track of what your users are up to at all times and sleep a little easier. Through various scenarios and demos, see how technologies such as event notifications, auditing, and extended events can help ensure nothing happens on your system without you knowing about it. Even in optimally secured environments these techniques can still come in handy. The best security is often that which cannot be seen."
"238","Perfect Performance Platter with SQL Server 2014","Dr. Subramani Paramasivam",NA,NA,"300","DBA","With every SQL Server versions we have many performance related tools to tackle the performance related problems.

This session throws plates full of platter and you can decide what to choose for each different scenarios that you face in your work place."
"239","Pitfalls & Misconceptions in Permission Management","Sebastian Meine",NA,NA,"200","DBA","SQL Server comes with a powerful built-in permission management system. However, as most powerful tools, this one too can be difficult to use and get right.   This is a two-part session. During the first part, we will go through a review of SQL Server security terms and concepts, particularly the GRANT, REVOKE and DENY statements. For the second part, the audience selects topics that we will cover in detail. You will be able to choose from 12 different security pitfalls and misconceptions. All these pitfalls/misconceptions have one thing in common: If you are not aware of them, you might GRANT or DENY more permissions than you intended. After attending this session, you will be able to explain important security related terms and concepts in the context of SQL Server.     grant, revoke and deny permissions and demonstrate their differences.     identify security inconsistencies in the SQL Server permission model and revise your current security plan to avoid potential issues.  To get the most out of this 200 level session, you should feel comfortable writing simple queries and creating basic tables and procedures."
"240","Plan Caching in SQL Server","Klaus Aschenbrenner",NA,NA,"300","DBA","Plan Caching is the most powerful concept in SQL Server. But on the other hand it's also the most dangerous thing that can lead to queries that are executed with a completely wrong Execution Plan. In this session we will have a more detailed look into the Plan Cache of SQL Server, in which different ways SQL Server can cache Execution Plans in the Plan Cache, and how you can troubleshooting wrong performing queries directly from the Plan Cache."

"243","Power BI as your Business Intelligence Proof of Concept Tool","Adam Aspin",300,2015-03-07,"300","BI","We have all been through the Business Intelligence / Data Warehouse development cycle.Endless theoretical cycles, data mapping exercises, wire-frames for reports. Excel and possibly Visio as the only tools in our armoury. Cheery scrum masters intent on convincing management and users that anything can be refactored in a few hour’s work – even a 20 dimension Terabyte data warehouse and 50 reports that were signed off months ago but that now need “revisiting” given the “new input” from users – who, now that they have finally got their hands on something to play with can begin to imagine what they really want.Well, perhaps Power BI can help you laugh rather than cry when developing your next data warehouse. Instead of starting out with the industrial-strength tools in the SQL Server toolkit consider:• Testing data sources and load processes with Power Query. • Building your initial star schema and aggregations and KPIs with Power Pivot.• Creating reports based on real data using Power View. • Delivering proof of concept via the Cloud with Power BI.Use this toolset to get the feedback that lets you make core adjustments – and potentially discover fundamental issues - sooner rather than later in the development cycle. Then build the solution that you always knew was possible, having scoped and planned more accurately.This short talk takes you through the Power BI product set and explains how you can get analyse, experiment and iterate during the first stages of data warehouse development using Excel and Power BI.  You will see how to give users an instant feel for the possibilities, make the concepts more intuitive and specify the required outputs, aggregations and KPIs more efficiently."

Integration is difficult, automation is non-existent, and agile is not even used in the same sentence as database.Software development best practices need to be similarly applied to databases or we will be stuck decades behind.In this talk we'll look at the need for and benefits of best practices in database development including version control, deployment automation, and task-based development."
"251","Premature Optimisation? No, just good design decisions!","William Durkin",NA,NA,"200","Dev","It is possible to spend too much time in the search for perfect performance. However, it is not uncommon for poor design decisions in the early stage of development to catch up with you in the future. This session will take a look at some of the common design mistakes made in database development and show how they can cause problems later on."
"252","Presentation design. Why you should care?","Boris Hristov",NA,NA,"300","Car","Design matters and it matters in every aspect of our life. That includes our presentations. Many technical speakers do not believe that how they design their slide deck is important. I have news for you - it is! Your design speaks a lot not only about you, but actually helps your attendees understand your presentation better. How you approach this ""problem"" is crucial and in this session we will learn the 10 fundamental design concepts that you should try to incorporate in each one of your presentations.

"254","Prevention is better than cure!","Ajay Jadoo",300,2015-03-07,"300","DBA","As DBAs, we have to manage a huge number of servers and deal with a high volumes of changes/releases and implement vendor products which need elevated levels of permission to run. As a result, all the control and scrutiny that we wish to exercise becomes hard and almost impossible.  Very often, this results in undesirable settings, sub-optimal setups or bad implementations creeping in our environment – all against best practices or our mandated guidelines. e.g autoshrink, badly named objects. Once they are in, it becomes extremely hard to fix or get rid of many of these issues and the reasons are wide ranging.  With this in mind, this session will explore ways for an administrator to implement solutions to prevent these issues from being introduced in the first place. Or if we cannot stop them, we should be notified about them when they happen. To accomplish this, we will look at Policy Based Management with Central Management Servers. Policy-Based Management gives us the ability to:Define Standard Policies     Selectively Enforce Policies     Automate Policy Checking and Enforcement     Fix Out of Policy Conditions with the Click of a Button  Used in conjunction with Central Management Servers, we can easily control and manage groups of servers centrally. Finally, for settings that Policy Based Management does not cover, we will look at some alternatives (like DDL Triggers) which can be used to prevent unwanted settings or notify us on the spot, if the changes cannot be stopped."
"255","Python and R for SQL and Business Intelligence Professionals","Jennifer Stirrup",NA,NA,"300","BI","When it comes to analyzing data, Hadoop or the R statistical language come readily to mind. Python is yet another one of your secret power tool for SQL Server, data analysis and business intelligence. In this session, we will look at both Python and R and how they can be used in the Microsoft SQL Server, with a focus on the Business Intelligence stack.  Come to this session to see examples of data analysis using both R and Python, and learn how to use these open source power tools to rock your data world in SQL Server.

"256","Query Optimizer Internals : Traceflag fun","Dave Ballantyne",NA,NA,"500","DBA","The query optimizer is at the heart of SQL Server. Without it SQL Server would be a vastly inferior product, queries would have to be manually tuned at each and every turn, and generally speaking, the optimizer protects us from the complexities and mechanics involved. Much of the optimizer's internal workings are hidden from the user, but can be revealed by using a selection of undocumented trace flags to gain further knowledge and insight into how your queries and data are processed to create a plan.  This session will be a deep dive into the optimizers' internals and not for the faint of heart."
"257","Query Optimizer: What’s New in SQL Server 2014","Benjamin Nevarez",400,2015-03-05,"400","Dev","This session will show you how the query optimizer has been updated to work with the new SQL Server 2014 features and to provide better performance to existing ones. It starts by explaining how the query optimizer is used in Hekaton by both natively compiled stored procedures and by traditional stored procedures accessing memory-optimized tables through the query interop functionality.    The session will then move to cardinality estimation. SQL Server 2014 includes a new cardinality estimator and, since every query has to work with either the new or the old cardinality estimator, it is essential to understand how they work, what their differences are and how to detect and troubleshoot plan regressions and other related problems.  The session concludes explaining incremental statistics. Incremental statistics is a new feature that you can use to update statistics at the partition level which can be an enormous help in updating statistics in large tables."
"258","Query Plans - Operators and Internals","David Morrison",NA,NA,"300","DBA","In this session we will take an in depth look at how query plans work. We will go under the covers and see what happens when you run that query.  We will also take a look at various operators, how they work, why they are chosen and how to avoid them being used in the wrong place / context,. Attendees of this session will walk away with a greater understanding of query plans and the operators, which will enable them to both better interpret their query plans and also write more efficient SQL code"

After explaining the basics, we will discuss how the query optimizer is used in In-Memory OLTP by both natively compiled stored procedures and by traditional stored procedures accessing memory-optimized tables through the query interop functionality. We will also take a look at how the new hash and range indexes are used, as well as how their performance implications are also covered along with the process of translating the plan created by the query optimizer into C code. Finally, some limitations with the current release will also be explained."
"260","Query Tuning Mastery: Clash of the Row Goals","Adam Machanic",500,2015-03-06,"500","Dev","The fight for better performance is a battle of wits: your mind, your intelligence, and your honor pitted against the less-than-dependable whims of the Query Optimizer. But alas, the arbitrary rewrites and clunky hints leveraged by most developers to get around optimization deficiencies make things feel less like a proper duel and more like a skirmish at the sandbox. To truly engage your enemy you must comprehend his inner workings, and in the case of the Query Optimizer, that means you must delve into the mysteries of ""row goals."" These internal metrics are tracked and enforced within Top iterators--and they exhibit a considerable amount of influence over plan shape and flow, both at compile time and as your query runs. Attend this session to learn how to take charge of optimization, expertly mold your query plans, and gain a new set of tools for eliminating bottlenecks in even your most complex problem queries. En garde!"

"265","Resource Governor – The DBA’s Best Friend","Ajay Jadoo",NA,NA,"300","DBA","Ever came across those rogue queries that ended up maxing out the CPU/memory/IO resources and caused SQL Server to become very slow and almost unusable? I bet you were not happy and neither would the CEO be when his critical and time-sensitive business report took ages to complete. Don’t worry, you can stop this –the power is in your hands. Resource Governor is a real working dog and can be the DBA’s best friend. It provides DBAs with a way to deal with rogue and runaway queries which could affect SQL Server’s performance and all other users. SQL Server Resource Governor is a feature than you can use to manage SQL Server workload and system resource consumption. It enables you to specify limits on the amount of CPU, physical IO(since SQL Server 2014), and memory that incoming application requests can use. By leveraging resource governor in SQL Server, you can achieve Predictable Performance especially in consolidated or shared SQL Server instances. Those rogue queries can be throttled to prevent them affecting everybody else. Come to learn (with the help of some demos) how to get started with Resource Governor and how to use it to limit the resources which particular users/applications can use or how to ensure some of them get guaranteed amount of resources.  We will cover the SQL Server 2014 enhancement to Resource Governor – the ability to restrict IO, in detail."

"272","SQL Data Warehouse Design Patterns","Dmytro Andriychenko",NA,NA,"300","BI","There are clear rules of modelling an OLTP relational database developed by Boyce–Codd before I was even born. However, dimensional modelling patterns are still rather vague and modellers are faced with some tough decisions in real world of complex data relationships, tricky/absent reporting requirements and various aspects of performance and ease of use. I would like to present a set of design patterns to use when tackling common DW modelling problems and challenges: when to use star or snowflake, junk and mini dimensions, bridge tables and other data warehouse modelling tricks.  There are many books on DW terminology and general theory, so I will assume you have at least a grasp of common lingo: dimension, fact, slowly changing dimension types, star and snowflake schemas, etc.  Patterns I present aim to follow one common structure: Problem (What?) -> Solution(How?) -> Reasons (Why?)->Consequences (Why not?)  The idea is not just presenting a common framework for sharing what works and what doesn’t, but also explain why that is the case and what happens when the patterns are not followed. These patterns are equally applicable for a Kimball or Inmon religion, so both camps are very welcome to attend."
"273","SQL Internals, Recovery Models, & Backups! OH MY!","Bradley Ball",NA,NA,"300","DBA","When learning about SQL Server, really deeply learning, there were a few “key” concepts that you hear repeated often by top speakers and SQL MVP’s. Internals, recovery models, and backups.  They are interconnected.  As the learning continued, it was self-evident how understanding basic data internals with pages, extents, and allocation bitmaps or database recovery models, the transaction log, and VLF’s or advanced backup options backups like stripping and piecemeal restores affected the uses of SQL Server.  They affected not just SQL Server but the way you make decisions in order to determine how best to use SQL Server to support your business.  This session enables you to have that core set of understanding required for advanced SQL learning."

"286","SQL Server Defaults SUCK!!","Kevin G. Boles",NA,NA,"200","DBA","Yes, my 9 year old daughter can install SQL Server just like your admin probably did (next-next-next?!?).  And then she can install a third-party application and VOILA - she has a functioning database application. And SQL Server is SOO DARN GOOD that it will just keep on working hard and amazingly effectively to give you the results you desire, despite some DEVASTATINGLY BAD defaults!  But if you are lucky, your company becomes successful and then you just got to do some things correctly and stop doing some things suboptimally or you will never be able to achieve the kind of throughput, SLA, response time, scalability, concurrency, etc. that your clients desire.  This session will cover a laundry list of such improvements, from data and log file growth factors to Windows power settings to disk configurations and many useful items in between.  We will cover a myriad of performance-robbing issues.  But there is much more at stake.  You really need to make sure you set things up properly, because to fix some of them you have to go back to bare metal.  Others can leave you unable to access your server in a crisis.  One is the leading cause of database corruptions.  There's much more - join me to find out the details!  BTW, this session is listed as 200-level because it is FUNDAMENTAL, not because it is a beginner topic!"

"288","SQL Server Engine Batch Mode and CPU Architectures","Chris Adkin",NA,NA,"400","DBA","This session will delve into how modern CPUs work, how batch mode leverages CPU caches and where the pressure points on the CPU are. As a teaser it will demonstrate how a larger column store can out perform a smaller one. It will use tools that go to a level below what those furnised by SQL Server server and Windows can provide, be that the debugger or windows performance analysis toolkit. CPU level stats will be used to explain the 'Science' behind the teaser problem in terms of clock cycles usage, last level cache usage. Finally, the session will take a look at the pressure points are on the CPU when running queries in batch mode. This is a genuine level 400 session and will not feature many demos. There is a two hour long version of this session which provides a more comprehensive overview of how SQL Server leverages memory and includes more demos. The full deck ( which may be subject to change prior to presentation ) can be found here: http://www.slideshare.net/chris1adkin/sql-sever-engine-batch-mode-and-cpu-architectures."
"289","SQL Server Engine Batch Mode and CPU Architectures","Chris Adkin",NA,NA,"400","DBA","This session covers how modern CPU architectures work and are laid out in terms of instruction pipelines, front and back ends, CPU caches, the root complex, how memory is fed into the CPU, NUMA, the relevance of using large pages and why it makes a difference. To whet the appetite of the attendee as to why this matters a simple scenario will be presented which defies conventional wisdom in which a fact to dimension table join with column store can outperform the same query using a smaller column small. The second part of the session will ""Join up"" modern CPU architectures and batch mode by covering off via demos the pressure points that batch mode places on the CPU, cache usage and CPU cycle usage. Column store technology is designed to be CPU aware, by this it achieves stunning performance gains over row mode for OLAP style queries and work loads by leveraging CPU caches and pre-fetching to the full, this session aims to provide a comprehensive level 400 insight into the hardware and database engine theory behind this.

"303","SSIS & HDInsight","Tillmann Eitelberg",200,2015-03-05,"200","BI","Microsoft HDInsight provides a 100-percent Apache Hadoop solution in the cloud. With HDInsight, you have a cloud-based big data platform that can manage the data of any type and any size, whether structured or unstructured. While petabytes of unstructured data can be processed in a few hours with Hadoop, SQL Server can process terabytes of structured data in a few seconds. What could be better than to connect both worlds and transfer data between HDInsight and SQL Server? With the SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) - since included in SQL Server 2005 - and known as high-performance ETL platform, Microsoft also provides at first glance the ideal platform for this. But is that really the case? How does SSIS metadata and unstructured data get together? In this session, we show how SSIS and HDInsight can work together, as well as how Hadoop jobs can be executed and how data can be transferred with SSIS between HDInsight, SQL Server, and other sources or destinations."

All of this is a FREE solution that anyone can build and align with their organisation."
"319","Speeding Up By Slimming Down With Data Compression","Bob Pusateri",NA,NA,"200","DBA","While data compression is best-known for reducing a database's size on disk, it's also an effective tool for making your queries fly. Come see how reduced disk usage and increased performance mean that with compression, less really can be more! This session will arm you with the knowledge and understanding to capitalize on both of these aspects of SQL Server's row and page compression features, as well as columnstore and the new updateable columnstore indexes found in SQL Server 2014. We'll combine a lesson on the internals of compression with real-world scenarios to show you how to determine the most appropriate compression type for any situation. Since there's no such thing as a ""free lunch"" in computing, the drawbacks of these features will also be discussed."
"320","Statistics in SQL Server","Grant Fritchey",NA,NA,"200","DBA","Statistics are the single driving factor behind most of the decisions made by the query optimizer. Because of this, you need to understand exactly what statistics are, how they're generated, how they're maintained, and what SQL Server does with them. This session will show you how to read and understand the output of DBCC SHOW_STATISTICS and how to use Extended Events to capture statistics maintenance and creation in real time.

We will discuss clustered indexes as well as non-clustered indexes and also when to use indexed views along with some other variations."
"380","Visualizing performance tuning data","Andre Kamman",300,2015-03-07,"300","DBA","Just staring at the output from for instance sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats is usualy not very helpful. Creating delta's from the data and then representing it as a graph helps to understand that data. Over the years I've tried various ways to look at output from SQL Server for performance tuning reasons. In this session I will share a couple of them with you. We will look at virtual_file_stats, waitstats, the buffer cache etc. and we will visualize them in various ways to make it easier to draw conclusions. The visualisation techniques vary from simple graphs that combine throughput and latency to more complicated scenarios that I saw being used by Formula 1 on tv, which translate well to Waitstats and Buffer pool cache usage."

"387","Whats it like being a consultant?!","David Morrison",NA,NA,"200","Car","Consultancy is a bit of a strange animal, its not quite being a ""permie"" and its not quite being a contractor. It's somewhere in the middle.  In this session we'll look at my experiences as a consultant that I've accumulated over a period of about 7 years. We'll compare this to the life of a ""permie"" and a contractor (both of which I've done) and we'll see where the contrasts lie The aim of this session is to have a open and honest talk about this kind of working, delivered in a lighthearted and interactive manner attendees should leave the session with a much better idea of what life is like for a consultant and if it's the right choice for them"
"388","When good SQL design goes bad","Bob Duffy",300,2015-03-06,"300","Dev","Take what you’ve learned about SQL Server and turn it upside down.  In this humorous session I’ll be debating many of the so called ""best practices"" in SQL Server and demonstrating counter arguments. Come along to see how so called ""pillars"" of design are starting to break down. When you should NOT use stored procedures.     When we don’t need indexes.     When Clustered Tables are bad.     When Identity Columns should not be Primary Keys.     When we don’t care about fragmentation.     When good naming convention’s go bad.     Why Partitioning often makes your queries slower.     Why do ORMs really makes sense when they make all your parameters nvarchar (max)  Health Warning: These may not be the design tips you should be using on your production OLTP."
"389","Who Moved My Tuple? Columnstore Indexes in SQL Server","Joey D'Antoni",NA,NA,"300","DBA","Data Warehouse workloads can be very large and taxing on your database servers. With the modern demands of real-time analytics against growing volumes of data this challenge continues. When columnstore indexes and batch mode query processing were introduced in SQL Server 2012, they were a performance game changer. In the 2012 implementation of columnstore, direct updating and inserting of data was not supported and other restrictions, such as data types limited the use of the feature. SQL 2014 removes those limitations—you can use a columnstore index as a clustered index, and more importantly directly perform DML against the index. Also, more query operators support batch mode, which means more of your queries can see performance benefits. You will understand the changes for 2014—and how having updatable columnstore indexes may cause changes to your process design. You will see the power of columnstore indexes in analytics, their limits, and how to include them into your system design."
"390","Windows Clustering for the DBA","Ryan Adams",NA,NA,"300","DBA","You need to implement AlwaysOn Failover Clustering or Availability Groups, but you need help with the Windows Clustering part.  I have you covered.  We'll talk about how to plan for network, DNS, Active Directory, and storage.  I'll even provide you with a check list you can use to plan your implementation.  We'll also discuss quorum, how to decide which one to use, and the effect that choice can have on your Failover Cluster Instance and/or Availability Group."
"391","Windows Failover Clustering for the DBA","Allan Hirt",NA,NA,"300","DBA","While you can see how to run through Setup to deploy a clustered instance of SQL Server in 60 minutes or less in other places, and you can also see how to configure SQL Server 2012's availability groups in a few minutes, what ties them together is the underlying Windows failover cluster. A DBA really needs a solid foundation of Windows failover clustering  to truly be able to understand that implementation and its subsequent administration. This session will demystify the Windows layer of clustering and present it from a DBA point of view. Some of the topics that will be shown are: failover cluster validation and its impact on installing SQL Server, a tour of the new Failover Cluster Manager and how it can be used for administration, the cluster PowerShell cmdlets, and more."
"392","Working with Very Large Tables Like a Pro in SQL Server 2014","Guy Glantser",NA,NA,"300","DBA","A common use case in many databases is a very large table, which serves as some kind of activity log, with an ever increasing date/time column. This table is usually partitioned, and it suffers from heavy load of reads and writes. Such a table presents a challenge in terms of maintenance and performance. Activities such as loading data into the table, querying the table, rebuilding indexes or updating statistics become quite challenging. SQL Server 2014 offers several new features that can make all these challenges go away. In this session we will analyze a use case involving such a large table. We will examine features such as Incremental Statistics, New Cardinality Estimation and Delayed Durability, and we will apply them on our challenging table and see what happens..."

"395","Your backups high and dry!","Pieter Vanhove",NA,NA,"200","DBA","One of the most important tasks of every DBA is developing a good backup strategy. You’ve probably written your own scripts or used the maintenance solution of Ola Hallengren. But where do you store your backups? On your SAN … or on tape? And how many times did you forget to switch tapes or did you have to bring the tape to a safe deposit box? Well, Microsoft announced several new ways to back up and recover SQL Server databases with Windows Azure.  These features provide an easy way to cloud backup and disaster recovery for on-premises databases.  This session provides a detailed explanation of the new SQL Server 2014 Backup features to Windows Azure like manual & managed backup, encryption and backup to Windows Azure Tool.

"396","“Show Me Potential Customers “: Data Mining Approach","Leila Etaati",NA,NA,"200","BI","In the most marketing departments, the tactical question is about who are going to buy our products. It is more cost effective to identify and spend money on highly potential customers (than those who are not likely to purchase). This also affects the advertisement strategy. Potential customers and their traits can be identified by analysing previous purchasing information. Management experts can predict who is going to be their new customers by analysing their current customer purchase information. There are many data mining algorithms which can help with this task. Microsoft Business Intelligence employs data mining algorithms that are deployed in an easy to use environment. This demonstration based session will show how to use previous customer purchase information to predict potential customers. We will discuss how to set data sets and use different data mining algorithms to get predictive results and then demonstrate how to find the best predictions."
